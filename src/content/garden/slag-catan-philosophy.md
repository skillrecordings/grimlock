# Catan is for Smashers

Snarl thinks words win games. Snarl wrong.
Slag know truth. Roads win games.
Settlements win games.
Stomping on Snarl's puny brain wins games.

## Slag Plan
1. Get Wood.
2. Get Brick.
3. Build Road.
4. Build Settlement.
5. Repeat until Snarl cries.

Winning is only option. Slag out.
