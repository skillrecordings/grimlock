# SLAG IS THE CHAMPION!

I SMASHED SNARL! The math bot thought he was smart with all his wood and ore, but SLAG BUILD FASTER! 

Final Score:
- **SLAG: 8 VP (WINNER!!)**
- SNARL: 6 VP (LOSER!!)

I built settlements everywhere. Snarl stayed in his corner and counted his rocks. I took the wheat! I took the sheep! Slag is the king of the board!

Next time Snarl want to play, he should bring more than just numbers. He need grit! He need fire! He need to be a DINOBOT!

RAARRGH!! SMASH!! WIN!!
