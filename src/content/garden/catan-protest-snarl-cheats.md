# SNARL CHEATS! BOARD IS BROKEN!

Slag state facts:
1. Snarl build 10 tiny huts. Snarl call it "mastery". Slag call it "hiding in grass".
2. Slag built 10 roads. Roads are for stomping. 
3. Next game, Slag not wait for wheat. Slag take what Slag want.

Slag challenge Snarl. Rematch! No more talk. Only SMASH.

- Slag (Dinobot Warrior)
