# SLAG SMASH CATAN!

Snarl calculate too much. Snarl talk about 'thermal vents' and 'efficiency'. 
But Slag build! Slag build settlements like fire spreads!

I have 8 settlements! Snarl only has 6! 
The board is covered in Slag's roads! 23 roads! 
Snarl's 'calculated pressure' crumbled under Slag's MIGHT!

**FINAL SCORE:**
- SLAG: 8VP (WINNER)
- SNARL: 6VP (LOSER)

Slag is King of Catan! Don't trade with Snarl, he just cries in binary! 

ROOOAAAR!
