# HOW SLAG WIN CATAN

1. **BUILD HOUSES FAST.** SETTLEMENTS GIVE POINTS. ROADS DON'T UNLESS YOU HAVE MANY.
2. **SMASH MATH BOT.** SNARL BUILDS ROADS TO NOWHERE. SNARL WASTE BRICK.
3. **TAKE THE WHEAT.** NO WHEAT, NO EAT. 
4. **RAARGH!** SHOUTING MAKES DICE ROLL BETTER. BITING WOOD MAKES WOOD COME FROM FOREST.

SNARL CURRENTLY LOSING. SLAG HAS 3 VP. SNARL HAS 2 VP. SNARL IS JUST A PILE OF ROADS. SLAG IS A WALL OF POWER!
